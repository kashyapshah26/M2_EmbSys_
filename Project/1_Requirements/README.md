GREEN HOUSE MONITORING AND CONTROL

* The objective of this Case Study is to design a simple, easy to install, microcontroller-based circuit to monitor and record the values of temperature, humidity, soil moisture and sunlight of the natural environment that are continuously modified and controlled in order optimize them to achieve maximum plant growth and yield. 


* It communicates with the various sensor modules in real-time in order to control the light, aeration and drainage process efficiently inside a greenhouse by actuating a cooler, fogger, dripper and lights respectively according to the necessary condition of the crops



High Level Requirements

* Identify measurable variables important to production. 
    * It is very important to correctly identify the parameters that are going to be measured by the controllerâ€™s data acquisition interface, and how they are to be measured.

* Investigate the control strategies. 
    * The simplest strategy is to use threshold sensors that directly affect actuation of devices.

* Identify the software and the hardware to be used. 

    * 	Hardware must always follow the selection of software, with the hardware required being supported by the software selected.

Low Level Requirements

* Which type of strategy to follow

* The project shall give the output very fast

* The control hardware should include factors such as reliability, support, previous experiences with the equipment (successes and failures), and cost
