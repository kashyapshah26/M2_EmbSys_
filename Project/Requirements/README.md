High Level Requirements

* Identify measurable variables important to production. 
    * It is very important to correctly identify the parameters that are going to be measured by the controllerâ€™s data acquisition interface, and how they are to be measured.

* Investigate the control strategies. 
    * The simplest strategy is to use threshold sensors that directly affect actuation of devices.

* Identify the software and the hardware to be used. 

    * 	Hardware must always follow the selection of software, with the hardware required being supported by the software selected.

Low Level Requirements

* Which type of strategy to follow

* The project shall give the output very fast

* The control hardware should include factors such as reliability, support, previous experiences with the equipment (successes and failures), and cost
