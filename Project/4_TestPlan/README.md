The unit will monitor the conditions of various parameter considerations and take appropriate action. Action taken is as follows:

    If temperature is lower than the set point: Heater relay will Turn ON and fan will turn OFF.

    If temperature is higher than the set point: then Fan will be Turned ON and heater will turn OFF.

    If Humidity is higher than the set point: then Fan / Humidifier will be Turned ON and heater / Dehumidifier will turn OFF.

    If Humidity is lower than the set point: then Fan / Humidifier will be Turned OFF and heater / Dehumidifier will turn ON.

    IIf temperature is higher than the set point: then Fan will be Turned ON and heater will turn OFF.

    If Light Intensity is higher than the set point: turn OFF the bulb.

    If Light Intensity is lower than the set point: turn ON the bulb.
